# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: '2')

#Example: This is one row inserted into the Country table
#Country.create(name: "United States", country_abbreviation: "USA")
#State.create(country_id: '1', name: "Texas", state_abbreviation: "TX")
#State.destroy_all
#Country.destroy_all
#User.destroy_all
